### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Nikolai, and I'm currently open to working in the Netherlands.

With 9 years of experience as a **Frontend Developer**, I've worked in both product and outsourcing environments. My main stack revolves around **React and TypeScript**, also proficient in **fundamentals** such as vanilla JavaScript (ECMAScript 6+), and pure HTML/CSS. I'm fond of writing types and tests to ensure the reliability of the code. Perform well as a team member and am capable of working independently. HSM visa holder.

I'm reliable, attentive to details, and motivated to achieve the best results. You can see my open repositories, this is a place where I **experiment and learn**, it is not very teamwork production style code.
